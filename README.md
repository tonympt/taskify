# <img src="./public/logo.svg" alt="Logo" width="60" /> Taskify a Clone of Trello

For this project, my goal was to recreate a clone of the [Trello](https://trello.com/fr) web application using the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) framework, a library that leverages [ReactJS](https://fr.react.dev/) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en) technologies. In terms of UI design, the app adopts the basic design of Trello, which in turn is an interpretation of the Kanban method. To achieve this result, I used the customizable components of [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) and the [tailwind css](https://tailwindcss.com/) framework. For the server side, I implemented all the logic with Next.js [server actions](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/server-actions-and-mutations) and [api routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/routing/api-routes), depending on their relevance. These communicate with a [MySQL](https://mysql.com/fr/) database via the [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) ORM. For authentication management, I chose a simple solution using [Clerk](https://clerk.dev/).

## Conception

<div align="center">

<br/>

This diagram explains the application architecture and its use of **Server Side Rendering** (SSR) by [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

Next.js, being an isomorphic framework, allows the same JavaScript code to be executed both on the _server_ and the _client_. This means that React components can be rendered server-side to generate the initial HTML _(Step 1)_, and then "hydrated" on the client-side _(Step 2)_ to allow dynamic interaction without requiring a full page load for each action.

Upon first connection, the client accesses the [landing-page](<./app/(marketing)>) and is then redirected to the authentication pages ([sign-in, sign-up, select-org](<./app/(platform)/(clerk)>)) managed and protected by the [middleware](./middleware.ts) of the Clerk tool. The **landing page** is a good example of a page rendered statically.

For this first project with Next.js, I wanted to experiment with data fetching through two Next.js features: [api routes](./app/api/) and [server actions](./actions/) (stable since version 14).

Regarding **API Routes**, I coupled them with the **react-query** library for its ease of use and also its cache data management (notably refetching keys).
As for **Server Actions**, this solution simplifies the execution of server logic without requiring dedicated API routes. However, through this solution, the entry point is not necessarily fully secure, especially for forms. Therefore, I created a [data verification function](./lib/create-safe-action.ts), taking the Zod schema as parameters as well as server logic and data retrieval. Finally, [use-action](./hooks/use-action.ts), on the client level, acts somewhat like the **useMutation** method of react-query, taking the action callback and success and error methods to display them at the client level.

For data fetching, I opted for the [ORM Prisma](./prisma/schema.prisma) which:

- Automatically generates a Prisma client based on our database schema,
- Is TypeScript friendly across the entire ecosystem,
- Manages MySQL,
- Allows simplified migration,
- Proposes schema-driven development,
- Enables intuitive query building.

For subscription management, Stripe manages user subscriptions through sessions.
